HTML: Description of the webpage. Basic building block of webpage.
Markup → annotations/ tags
Hyper text → one web page is linked to another page.

Browser renders the HTML document.

Tag: is something that tells the browser how to render different elements.

HTML is case insensitive.

HTML Text ELements: Block elements and inline elements.

Block: h1 to h6, p
Inline: em, strong

Empty/ Self closing tag: br, input
img can be both self closing and non self closing.

3 types of list: ol, ul, description list.

H1 tag to be used only once in a bag → good practice.

!DocType HTML → line tells the browser that this is an html 5 document

Pre tag → text written inside the pre tag will show up on screen as written in the html file.
It solves the poet problem.
